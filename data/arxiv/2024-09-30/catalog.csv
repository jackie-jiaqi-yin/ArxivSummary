LML: Language Model Learning a Dataset for Data-Augmented Prediction,Praneeth Vadlapati,"This paper introduces a new approach to using Large Language Models (LLMs)
for classification tasks, which are typically handled using Machine Learning
(ML) models. Unlike ML models that rely heavily on data cleaning and feature
engineering, this method streamlines the process using LLMs. This paper
proposes a new concept called ""Language Model Learning (LML)"" powered by a new
method called ""Data-Augmented Prediction (DAP)"". The classification is
performed by LLMs using a method similar to humans manually exploring and
understanding the data and deciding classifications using data as a reference.
Training data is summarized and evaluated to determine the features that lead
to the classification of each label the most. In the process of DAP, the system
uses the data summary to automatically create a query, which is used to
retrieve relevant rows from the dataset. A classification is generated by the
LLM using data summary and relevant rows, ensuring satisfactory accuracy even
with complex data. Usage of data summary and similar data in DAP ensures
context-aware decision-making. The proposed method uses the words ""Act as an
Explainable Machine Learning Model"" in the prompt to enhance the
interpretability of the predictions by allowing users to review the logic
behind each prediction. In some test cases, the system scored an accuracy above
90%, proving the effectiveness of the system and its potential to outperform
conventional ML models in various scenarios. The code is available at

Ruler: A Model-Agnostic Method to Control Generated Length for Large Language Models,"Jiaming Li, Lei Zhang, Yunshui Li, Ziqiang Liu, yuelin bai, Run Luo, Longze Chen, Min Yang","The instruction-following ability of large language models enables humans to
interact with AI agents in a natural way. However, when required to generate
responses of a specific length, large language models often struggle to meet
users' needs due to their inherent difficulty in accurately perceiving
numerical constraints. To explore the ability of large language models to
control the length of generated responses, we propose the Target Length
Generation Task (TLG) and design two metrics, Precise Match (PM) and Flexible
Match (FM) to evaluate the model's performance in adhering to specified
response lengths. Furthermore, we introduce a novel, model-agnostic approach
called Ruler, which employs Meta Length Tokens (MLTs) to enhance the
instruction-following ability of large language models under length-constrained
instructions. Specifically, Ruler equips LLMs with the ability to generate
responses of a specified length based on length constraints within the
instructions. Moreover, Ruler can automatically generate appropriate MLT when
length constraints are not explicitly provided, demonstrating excellent
versatility and generalization. Comprehensive experiments show the
effectiveness of Ruler across different LLMs on Target Length Generation Task,
e.g., at All Level 27.97 average gain on PM, 29.57 average gain on FM. In
addition, we conduct extensive ablation experiments to further substantiate the
efficacy and generalization of Ruler. Our code and data is available at

From Seconds to Hours: Reviewing MultiModal Large Language Models on Comprehensive Long Video Understanding,"Heqing Zou, Tianze Luo, Guiyang Xie, Victor, Zhang, Fengmao Lv, Guangcong Wang, Juanyang Chen, Zhuochen Wang, Hansheng Zhang, Huaijian Zhang","The integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) with visual encoders has
recently shown promising performance in visual understanding tasks, leveraging
their inherent capability to comprehend and generate human-like text for visual
reasoning. Given the diverse nature of visual data, MultiModal Large Language
Models (MM-LLMs) exhibit variations in model designing and training for
understanding images, short videos, and long videos. Our paper focuses on the
substantial differences and unique challenges posed by long video understanding
compared to static image and short video understanding. Unlike static images,
short videos encompass sequential frames with both spatial and within-event
temporal information, while long videos consist of multiple events with
between-event and long-term temporal information. In this survey, we aim to
trace and summarize the advancements of MM-LLMs from image understanding to
long video understanding. We review the differences among various visual
understanding tasks and highlight the challenges in long video understanding,
including more fine-grained spatiotemporal details, dynamic events, and
long-term dependencies. We then provide a detailed summary of the advancements
in MM-LLMs in terms of model design and training methodologies for
understanding long videos. Finally, we compare the performance of existing
MM-LLMs on video understanding benchmarks of various lengths and discuss
potential future directions for MM-LLMs in long video understanding.",2024-09-27 17:38:36+00:00,cs.CV,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.18938v1,From_Seconds_to_Hours_Reviewing_MultiModal_Large_Language_Models_on_Comprehensive_Long_Video_Understanding

effectiveness and trustworthiness of these systems remains a challenge, as they
require a large, diverse, and precise patient knowledgebase, along with a
robust and stable knowledge diffusion to users. Here, we developed AIPatient,

IDGen: Item Discrimination Induced Prompt Generation for LLM Evaluation,"Fan Lin, Shuyi Xie, Yong Dai, Wenlin Yao, Tianjiao Lang, Zishan Xu, Zhichao Hu, Xiao Xiao, Yuhong Liu, Yu Zhang","As Large Language Models (LLMs) grow increasingly adept at managing complex
tasks, the evaluation set must keep pace with these advancements to ensure it
remains sufficiently discriminative. Item Discrimination (ID) theory, which is
widely used in educational assessment, measures the ability of individual test
items to differentiate between high and low performers. Inspired by this
theory, we propose an ID-induced prompt synthesis framework for evaluating LLMs
to ensure the evaluation set can continually update and refine according to
model abilities. Our data synthesis framework prioritizes both breadth and
specificity. It can generate prompts that comprehensively evaluate the
capabilities of LLMs while revealing meaningful performance differences between
models, allowing for effective discrimination of their relative strengths and
weaknesses across various tasks and domains. To produce high-quality data, we
incorporate a self-correct mechanism into our generalization framework, and
develop two models to predict prompt discrimination and difficulty score to
facilitate our data synthesis framework, contributing valuable tools to
evaluation data synthesis research. We apply our generated data to evaluate
five SOTA models. Our data achieves an average score of 51.92, accompanied by a
variance of 10.06. By contrast, previous works (i.e., SELF-INSTRUCT and
WizardLM) obtain an average score exceeding 67, with a variance below 3.2. The
results demonstrate that the data generated by our framework is more

Mitigating Selection Bias with Node Pruning and Auxiliary Options,"Hyeong Kyu Choi, Weijie Xu, Chi Xue, Stephanie Eckman, Chandan K. Reddy","Large language models (LLMs) often show unwarranted preference for certain
choice options when responding to multiple-choice questions, posing significant
reliability concerns in LLM-automated systems. To mitigate this selection bias
problem, previous solutions utilized debiasing methods to adjust the model's
input and/or output. Our work, in contrast, investigates the model's internal
representation of the selection bias. Specifically, we introduce a novel
debiasing approach, Bias Node Pruning (BNP), which eliminates the linear layer
parameters that contribute to the bias. Furthermore, we present Auxiliary
Option Injection (AOI), a simple yet effective input modification technique for
debiasing, which is compatible even with black-box LLMs. To provide a more
systematic evaluation of selection bias, we review existing metrics and
introduce Choice Kullback-Leibler Divergence (CKLD), which addresses the

OpenObject-NAV: Open-Vocabulary Object-Oriented Navigation Based on Dynamic Carrier-Relationship Scene Graph,"Yujie Tang, Meiling Wang, Yinan Deng, Zibo Zheng, Jiagui Zhong, Yufeng Yue","In everyday life, frequently used objects like cups often have unfixed
positions and multiple instances within the same category, and their carriers
frequently change as well. As a result, it becomes challenging for a robot to
efficiently navigate to a specific instance. To tackle this challenge, the
robot must capture and update scene changes and plans continuously. However,
current object navigation approaches primarily focus on semantic-level and lack
the ability to dynamically update scene representation. This paper captures the
relationships between frequently used objects and their static carriers. It
constructs an open-vocabulary Carrier-Relationship Scene Graph (CRSG) and
updates the carrying status during robot navigation to reflect the dynamic
changes of the scene. Based on the CRSG, we further propose an instance
navigation strategy that models the navigation process as a Markov Decision
Process. At each step, decisions are informed by Large Language Model's
commonsense knowledge and visual-language feature similarity. We designed a

Model-based Preference Optimization in Abstractive Summarization without Human Feedback,"Jaepill Choi, Kyubyung Chae, Jiwoo Song, Yohan Jo, Taesup Kim","In abstractive summarization, the challenge of producing concise and accurate

Hit the Sweet Spot! Span-Level Ensemble for Large Language Models,"Yangyifan Xu, Jianghao Chen, Junhong Wu, Jiajun Zhang","Ensembling various LLMs to unlock their complementary potential and leverage
their individual strengths is highly valuable. Previous studies typically focus
on two main paradigms: sample-level and token-level ensembles. Sample-level
ensemble methods either select or blend fully generated outputs, which hinders
dynamic correction and enhancement of outputs during the generation process. On
the other hand, token-level ensemble methods enable real-time correction
through fine-grained ensemble at each generation step. However, the information
carried by an individual token is quite limited, leading to suboptimal
decisions at each step. To address these issues, we propose SweetSpan, a
span-level ensemble method that effectively balances the need for real-time
adjustments and the information required for accurate ensemble decisions. Our
approach involves two key steps: First, we have each candidate model
independently generate candidate spans based on the shared prefix. Second, we
calculate perplexity scores to facilitate mutual evaluation among the candidate
models and achieve robust span selection by filtering out unfaithful scores. To
comprehensively evaluate ensemble methods, we propose a new challenging setting
(ensemble models with significant performance gaps) in addition to the standard
setting (ensemble the best-performing models) to assess the performance of
model ensembles in more realistic scenarios. Experimental results in both
standard and challenging settings across various language generation tasks
demonstrate the effectiveness, robustness, and versatility of our approach
compared with previous ensemble methods.",2024-09-27 09:41:29+00:00,cs.CL,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.18583v1,Hit_the_Sweet_Spot_SpanLevel_Ensemble_for_Large_Language_Models
Experimental Evaluation of Machine Learning Models for Goal-oriented Customer Service Chatbot with Pipeline Architecture,"Nurul Ain Nabilah Mohd Isa, Siti Nuraishah Agos Jawaddi, Azlan Ismail","Integrating machine learning (ML) into customer service chatbots enhances
their ability to understand and respond to user queries, ultimately improving
service performance. However, they may appear artificial to some users and
affecting customer experience. Hence, meticulous evaluation of ML models for
each pipeline component is crucial for optimizing performance, though
differences in functionalities can lead to unfair comparisons. In this paper,
we present a tailored experimental evaluation approach for goal-oriented
customer service chatbots with pipeline architecture, focusing on three key
components: Natural Language Understanding (NLU), dialogue management (DM), and
Natural Language Generation (NLG). Our methodology emphasizes individual
assessment to determine optimal ML models. Specifically, we focus on optimizing
hyperparameters and evaluating candidate models for NLU (utilizing BERT and
LSTM), DM (employing DQN and DDQN), and NLG (leveraging GPT-2 and DialoGPT).
The results show that for the NLU component, BERT excelled in intent detection
whereas LSTM was superior for slot filling. For the DM component, the DDQN
model outperformed DQN by achieving fewer turns, higher rewards, as well as
greater success rates. For NLG, the large language model GPT-2 surpassed
DialoGPT in BLEU, METEOR, and ROUGE metrics. These findings aim to provide a

Research on Predicting Public Opinion Event Heat Levels Based on Large Language Models,"Yi Ren, Tianyi Zhang, Weibin Li, DuoMu Zhou, Chenhao Qin, FangCheng Dong","In recent years, with the rapid development of large language models, serval
models such as GPT-4o have demonstrated extraordinary capabilities, surpassing
human performance in various language tasks. As a result, many researchers have
begun exploring their potential applications in the field of public opinion
analysis. This study proposes a novel large-language-models-based method for
public opinion event heat level prediction. First, we preprocessed and
classified 62,836 Chinese hot event data collected between July 2022 and
December 2023. Then, based on each event's online dissemination heat index, we
used the MiniBatchKMeans algorithm to automatically cluster the events and
categorize them into four heat levels (ranging from low heat to very high
heat). Next, we randomly selected 250 events from each heat level, totalling
1,000 events, to build the evaluation dataset. During the evaluation process,
we employed various large language models to assess their accuracy in
predicting event heat levels in two scenarios: without reference cases and with
similar case references. The results showed that GPT-4o and DeepseekV2
performed the best in the latter case, achieving prediction accuracies of 41.4%
and 41.5%, respectively. Although the overall prediction accuracy remains
relatively low, it is worth noting that for low-heat (Level 1) events, the
prediction accuracies of these two models reached 73.6% and 70.4%,
respectively. Additionally, the prediction accuracy showed a downward trend
from Level 1 to Level 4, which correlates with the uneven distribution of data
across the heat levels in the actual dataset. This suggests that with the more
robust dataset, public opinion event heat level prediction based on large
language models will have significant research potential for the future.",2024-09-27 08:34:42+00:00,cs.CL,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.18548v1,Research_on_Predicting_Public_Opinion_Event_Heat_Levels_Based_on_Large_Language_Models

LLaVA-series models, are driven by massive machine-generated
instruction-following data tuning. Such automatic instruction collection
pipelines, however, inadvertently introduce significant variability in data
quality. This paper introduces a novel instruction curation algorithm, derived
from two unique perspectives, human and LLM preference alignment, to compress
this vast corpus of machine-generated multimodal instructions to a compact and
high-quality form: (i) For human preference alignment, we have collected a
machine-generated multimodal instruction dataset and established a
comprehensive set of both subjective and objective criteria to guide the data
quality assessment critically from human experts. By doing so, a reward model
was trained on the annotated dataset to internalize the nuanced human
understanding of instruction alignment. (ii) For LLM preference alignment,
given the instruction selected by the reward model, we propose leveraging the
inner LLM used in MLLM to align the writing style of visual instructions with
that of the inner LLM itself, resulting in LLM-aligned instruction improvement.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that we can maintain or even improve model
performance by compressing synthetic multimodal instructions by up to 90%.

Do We Need Domain-Specific Embedding Models? An Empirical Investigation,"Yixuan Tang, Yi Yang","Embedding models play a crucial role in representing and retrieving
information across various NLP applications. Recent advancements in Large
Language Models (LLMs) have further enhanced the performance of embedding
models, which are trained on massive amounts of text covering almost every
domain. These models are often benchmarked on general-purpose datasets like
Massive Text Embedding Benchmark (MTEB), where they demonstrate superior
performance. However, a critical question arises: Is the development of
domain-specific embedding models necessary when general-purpose models are
trained on vast corpora that already include specialized domain texts? In this
paper, we empirically investigate this question, choosing the finance domain as
an example. We introduce the Finance Massive Text Embedding Benchmark
(FinMTEB), a counterpart to MTEB that consists of financial domain-specific
text datasets. We evaluate the performance of seven state-of-the-art embedding
models on FinMTEB and observe a significant performance drop compared to their
performance on MTEB. To account for the possibility that this drop is driven by
FinMTEB's higher complexity, we propose four measures to quantify dataset
complexity and control for this factor in our analysis. Our analysis provides
compelling evidence that state-of-the-art embedding models struggle to capture
domain-specific linguistic and semantic patterns, even when trained on large
general-purpose corpora. This study sheds light on the necessity of developing
domain-specific embedding models in the LLM era, offering valuable insights for

VickreyFeedback: Cost-efficient Data Construction for Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback,"Guoxi Zhang, Jiuding Duan","This paper addresses the cost-efficiency aspect of Reinforcement Learning
from Human Feedback (RLHF). RLHF leverages datasets of human preferences over
outputs of large language models (LLM) to instill human expectations into LLMs.
While preference annotation comes with a monetized cost, the economic utility
of a preference dataset has not been considered by far. What exacerbates this
situation is that given complex intransitive or cyclic relationships in
preference datasets, existing algorithms for fine-tuning LLMs are still far
from capturing comprehensive preferences. This raises severe cost-efficiency
concerns in production environments, where preference data accumulate over
time. In this paper, we see the fine-tuning of LLMs as a monetized economy and
introduce an auction mechanism to improve the efficiency of the preference data
collection in dollar terms. We show that introducing an auction mechanism can
play an essential role in enhancing the cost-efficiency of RLHF while
maintaining satisfactory model performance. Experimental results demonstrate
that our proposed auction-based protocol is cost-efficient for fine-tuning LLMs

(NLP) by enabling robust text generation and understanding. However, their
deployment in sensitive domains like healthcare, finance, and legal services
raises critical concerns about privacy and data security. This paper proposes a
comprehensive framework for embedding trust mechanisms into LLMs to dynamically
control the disclosure of sensitive information. The framework integrates three
core components: User Trust Profiling, Information Sensitivity Detection, and
Adaptive Output Control. By leveraging techniques such as Role-Based Access
Control (RBAC), Attribute-Based Access Control (ABAC), Named Entity Recognition
(NER), contextual analysis, and privacy-preserving methods like differential
privacy, the system ensures that sensitive information is disclosed
appropriately based on the user's trust level. By focusing on balancing data
utility and privacy, the proposed solution offers a novel approach to securely
deploying LLMs in high-risk environments. Future work will focus on testing
this framework across various domains to evaluate its effectiveness in managing
sensitive data while maintaining system efficiency.",2024-09-26 19:02:33+00:00,cs.AI,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.18222v1,Trustworthy_AI_Securing_Sensitive_Data_in_Large_Language_Models
MMMT-IF: A Challenging Multimodal Multi-Turn Instruction Following Benchmark,"Elliot L. Epstein, Kaisheng Yao, Jing Li, Xinyi Bai, Hamid Palangi","Evaluating instruction following capabilities for multimodal, multi-turn
dialogue is challenging. With potentially multiple instructions in the input
model context, the task is time-consuming for human raters and we show LLM
based judges are biased towards answers from the same model. We propose
MMMT-IF, an image based multi-turn Q$\&$A evaluation set with added global
instructions between questions, constraining the answer format. This challenges
models to retrieve instructions dispersed across long dialogues and reason
under instruction constraints. All instructions are objectively verifiable
through code execution. We introduce the Programmatic Instruction Following
($\operatorname{PIF}$) metric to measure the fraction of the instructions that
are correctly followed while performing a reasoning task. The
$\operatorname{PIF-N-K}$ set of metrics further evaluates robustness by
measuring the fraction of samples in a corpus where, for each sample, at least
K out of N generated model responses achieve a $\operatorname{PIF}$ score of
one. The $\operatorname{PIF}$ metric aligns with human instruction following
ratings, showing 60 percent correlation. Experiments show Gemini 1.5 Pro,
GPT-4o, and Claude 3.5 Sonnet, have a $\operatorname{PIF}$ metric that drops
from 0.81 on average at turn 1 across the models, to 0.64 at turn 20. Across
all turns, when each response is repeated 4 times ($\operatorname{PIF-4-4}$),
GPT-4o and Gemini successfully follow all instructions only $11\%$ of the time.
When all the instructions are also appended to the end of the model input
context, the $\operatorname{PIF}$ metric improves by 22.3 points on average,
showing that the challenge with the task lies not only in following the
instructions, but also in retrieving the instructions spread out in the model
context. We plan to open source the MMMT-IF dataset and metric computation
code.",2024-09-26 18:51:46+00:00,cs.AI,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.18216v1,MMMTIF_A_Challenging_Multimodal_MultiTurn_Instruction_Following_Benchmark

Policy Projector, policy designers can survey the landscape of model
input-output pairs, define custom regions (e.g., ""violence""), and navigate
these regions with rules that can be applied to LLM outputs (e.g., if output

affects how effective these technologies are. Results reveal that while LLMs
can provide individualized learning and communication support, AR has
demonstrated promise in enhancing social skills, motivation, and attention. For

DualAD: Dual-Layer Planning for Reasoning in Autonomous Driving,"Dingrui Wang, Marc Kaufeld, Johannes Betz","We present a novel autonomous driving framework, DualAD, designed to imitate
human reasoning during driving. DualAD comprises two layers: a rule-based
motion planner at the bottom layer that handles routine driving tasks requiring
minimal reasoning, and an upper layer featuring a rule-based text encoder that
converts driving scenarios from absolute states into text description. This
text is then processed by a large language model (LLM) to make driving
decisions. The upper layer intervenes in the bottom layer's decisions when
potential danger is detected, mimicking human reasoning in critical situations.
Closed-loop experiments demonstrate that DualAD, using a zero-shot pre-trained
model, significantly outperforms rule-based motion planners that lack reasoning
abilities. Our experiments also highlight the effectiveness of the text
encoder, which considerably enhances the model's scenario understanding.

Compositional Hardness of Code in Large Language Models -- A Probabilistic Perspective,"Yotam Wolf, Binyamin Rothberg, Dorin Shteyman, Amnon Shashua","A common practice in large language model (LLM) usage for complex analytical
tasks such as code generation, is to sample a solution for the entire task
within the model's context window. Previous works have shown that subtask
decomposition within the model's context (chain of thought), is beneficial for
solving such tasks. In this work, we point a limitation of LLMs' ability to
perform several sub-tasks within the same context window - an in-context
hardness of composition, pointing to an advantage for distributing a decomposed
problem in a multi-agent system of LLMs. The hardness of composition is
quantified by a generation complexity metric, i.e., the number of LLM
generations required to sample at least one correct solution. We find a gap
between the generation complexity of solving a compositional problem within the
same context relative to distributing it among multiple agents, that increases
exponentially with the solution's length. We prove our results theoretically

DARE: Diverse Visual Question Answering with Robustness Evaluation,"Hannah Sterz, Jonas Pfeiffer, Ivan Vulić","Vision Language Models (VLMs) extend remarkable capabilities of text-only
large language models and vision-only models, and are able to learn from and

still struggle with a number of crucial vision-language (VL) reasoning
abilities such as counting and spatial reasoning. Moreover, while they might be
very brittle to small variations in instructions and/or evaluation protocols,
existing benchmarks fail to evaluate their robustness (or rather the lack of
it). In order to couple challenging VL scenarios with comprehensive robustness
evaluation, we introduce DARE, Diverse Visual Question Answering with
Robustness Evaluation, a carefully created and curated multiple-choice VQA

Language Models (LLMs) have been proven to be vulnerable to backdoor attacks.
These attacks introduce targeted vulnerabilities into LLMs by poisoning

attack is limited since they require significant computational resources,
especially as the size of LLMs increases. Besides, parameter-efficient
fine-tuning (PEFT) offers an alternative but the restricted parameter updating
may impede the alignment of triggers with target labels. In this study, we
first verify that backdoor attacks with PEFT may encounter challenges in
achieving feasible performance. To address these issues and improve the
effectiveness of backdoor attacks with PEFT, we propose a novel backdoor attack

contrastive knowledge distillation, which employs PEFT. Theoretical analysis
reveals that W2SAttack has the potential to augment the effectiveness of

question-answer pairs from Rori, a learning platform used by students in
several African countries and conducts two experiments to evaluate the use of
large language models (LLM) for grading particularly challenging student
answers. The AMMORE dataset enables various potential analyses and provides an
important resource for researching student math acquisition in understudied,
real-world, educational contexts. In experiment 1 we use a variety of
LLM-driven approaches, including zero-shot, few-shot, and chain-of-thought
prompting, to grade the 1% of student answers that a rule-based classifier
fails to grade accurately. We find that the best-performing approach --
chain-of-thought prompting -- accurately scored 92% of these edge cases,
effectively boosting the overall accuracy of the grading from 98.7% to 99.9%.
In experiment 2, we aim to better understand the consequential validity of the
improved grading accuracy, by passing grades generated by the best-performing
LLM-based approach to a Bayesian Knowledge Tracing (BKT) model, which estimated
student mastery of specific lessons. We find that relatively modest
improvements in model accuracy at the individual question level can lead to
significant changes in the estimation of student mastery. Where the rules-based
classifier currently used to grade student, answers misclassified the mastery
status of 6.9% of students across their completed lessons, using the LLM
chain-of-thought approach this misclassification rate was reduced to 2.6% of
students. Taken together, these findings suggest that LLMs could be a valuable
tool for grading open-response questions in K-12 mathematics education,
potentially enabling encouraging wider adoption of open-ended questions in
formative assessment.",2024-09-26 14:51:40+00:00,cs.AI,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.17904v1,Learning_to_Love_Edge_Cases_in_Formative_Math_Assessment_Using_the_AMMORE_Dataset_and_ChainofThought_Prompting_to_Improve_Grading_Accuracy

Efficient Arbitrary Precision Acceleration for Large Language Models on GPU Tensor Cores,"Shaobo Ma, Chao Fang, Haikuo Shao, Zhongfeng Wang","Large language models (LLMs) have been widely applied but face challenges in
efficient inference. While quantization methods reduce computational demands,
ultra-low bit quantization with arbitrary precision is hindered by limited GPU
Tensor Core support and inefficient memory management, leading to suboptimal
acceleration. To address these challenges, we propose a comprehensive
acceleration scheme for arbitrary precision LLMs. At its core, we introduce a
novel bipolar-INT data format that facilitates parallel computing and supports
symmetric quantization, effectively reducing data redundancy. Building on this,
we implement an arbitrary precision matrix multiplication scheme that
decomposes and recovers matrices at the bit level, enabling flexible precision
while maximizing GPU Tensor Core utilization. Furthermore, we develop an
efficient matrix preprocessing method that optimizes data layout for subsequent
computations. Finally, we design a data recovery-oriented memory management
system that strategically utilizes fast shared memory, significantly enhancing
kernel execution speed and minimizing memory access latency. Experimental
results demonstrate our approach's effectiveness, with up to 13\times speedup

Language Models as Zero-shot Lossless Gradient Compressors: Towards General Neural Parameter Prior Models,"Hui-Po Wang, Mario Fritz","Despite the widespread use of statistical prior models in various fields,
such models for neural network gradients have long been overlooked. The
inherent challenge stems from their high-dimensional structures and complex
interdependencies, which complicate effective modeling. In this work, we
demonstrate the potential of large language models (LLMs) to act as gradient
priors in a zero-shot setting. We examine the property by considering lossless
gradient compression -- a critical application in distributed learning -- that
depends heavily on precise probability modeling. To achieve this, we introduce
LM-GC, a novel method that integrates LLMs with arithmetic coding. Our
technique converts plain gradients into text-like formats, enhancing token
efficiency by up to 38 times compared to their plain representations. We ensure
that this data conversion maintains a close alignment with the structure of
plain gradients and the symbols commonly recognized by LLMs. Our experiments
indicate that LM-GC surpasses existing state-of-the-art lossless compression
methods, improving compression rates by 10\% up to 17.2\% across various

compatibility with lossy compression techniques such as quantization and
sparsification. These findings highlight the significant potential of LLMs as a

scaling effectively the same model architecture to larger datasets. In this
vein, recent work has highlighted performance gains from increasing training
dataset size and quality, suggesting a need for novel sources of large-scale
datasets. In this work, we introduce BeanCounter, a public dataset consisting
of more than 159B tokens extracted from businesses' disclosures. We show that
this data is indeed novel: less than 0.1% of BeanCounter appears in Common
Crawl-based datasets and it is an order of magnitude larger than datasets
relying on similar sources. Given the data's provenance, we hypothesize that
BeanCounter is comparatively more factual and less toxic than web-based
datasets. Exploring this hypothesis, we find that many demographic identities
occur with similar prevalence in BeanCounter but with significantly less toxic
context relative to other datasets. To demonstrate the utility of BeanCounter,
we evaluate and compare two LLMs continually pre-trained on BeanCounter with
their base models. We find an 18-33% reduction in toxic generation and improved
performance within the finance domain for the continually pretrained models.
Collectively, our work suggests that BeanCounter is a novel source of

Inference-Time Language Model Alignment via Integrated Value Guidance,"Zhixuan Liu, Zhanhui Zhou, Yuanfu Wang, Chao Yang, Yu Qiao","Large language models are typically fine-tuned to align with human
preferences, but tuning large models is computationally intensive and complex.
In this work, we introduce $\textit{Integrated Value Guidance}$ (IVG), a method
that uses implicit and explicit value functions to guide language model
decoding at token and chunk-level respectively, efficiently aligning large
language models purely at inference time. This approach circumvents the
complexities of direct fine-tuning and outperforms traditional methods.
Empirically, we demonstrate the versatility of IVG across various tasks. In
controlled sentiment generation and summarization tasks, our method
significantly improves the alignment of large models using inference-time
guidance from $\texttt{gpt2}$-based value functions. Moreover, in a more
challenging instruction-following benchmark AlpacaEval 2.0, we show that both
specifically tuned and off-the-shelf value functions greatly improve the
length-controlled win rates of large models against $\texttt{gpt-4-turbo}$

Self-supervised Preference Optimization: Enhance Your Language Model with Preference Degree Awareness,"Jian Li, Haojing Huang, Yujia Zhang, Pengfei Xu, Xi Chen, Rui Song, Lida Shi, Jingwen Wang, Hao Xu","Recently, there has been significant interest in replacing the reward model
in Reinforcement Learning with Human Feedback (RLHF) methods for Large Language
Models (LLMs), such as Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) and its variants.
These approaches commonly use a binary cross-entropy mechanism on pairwise

dis-preferred responses, respectively. However, while this training strategy
omits the reward model, it also overlooks the varying preference degrees within
different responses. We hypothesize that this is a key factor hindering LLMs
from sufficiently understanding human preferences. To address this problem, we
propose a novel Self-supervised Preference Optimization (SPO) framework, which
constructs a self-supervised preference degree loss combined with the alignment

a training set of pairs of queries and their relevant documents, its
performance is mostly worse than that of supervised models, which are trained
on such example pairs. Motivated by the existing findings that training
examples generally improve zero-shot performance, in our work, we explore if

were manually annotated and curated. NER performance was measured by using
strict and partial matching. For the task EX, two experts interpreted the
results by assessing semantic equivalence between original and expanded
statements. The model performance was measured by precision, recall, and F1

and compare many companies' strategy changes efficiently. We propose a novel
data-driven approach that leverages large language models (LLMs) to
systematically analyze and rate the performance of companies based on their SEC
10-K filings. These filings, which provide detailed annual reports on a
company's financial performance and strategic direction, serve as a rich source
of data for evaluating various aspects of corporate health, including
confidence, environmental sustainability, innovation, and workforce management.
We also introduce an automated system for extracting and preprocessing 10-K
filings. This system accurately identifies and segments the required sections
as outlined by the SEC, while also isolating key textual content that contains
critical information about the company. This curated data is then fed into
Cohere's Command-R+ LLM to generate quantitative ratings across various
performance metrics. These ratings are subsequently processed and visualized to
provide actionable insights. The proposed scheme is then implemented on an
interactive GUI as a no-code solution for running the data pipeline and
creating the visualizations. The application showcases the rating results and
provides year-on-year comparisons of company performance.",2024-09-26 06:57:22+00:00,cs.AI,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.17581v1,A_Scalable_DataDriven_Framework_for_Systematic_Analysis_of_SEC_10K_Filings_Using_Large_Language_Models

Logic-of-Thought: Injecting Logic into Contexts for Full Reasoning in Large Language Models,"Tongxuan Liu, Wenjiang Xu, Weizhe Huang, Xingyu Wang, Jiaxing Wang, Hailong Yang, Jing Li","Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across
various tasks but their performance in complex logical reasoning tasks remains
unsatisfactory. Although some prompting methods, such as Chain-of-Thought, can
improve the reasoning ability of LLMs to some extent, they suffer from an
unfaithful issue where derived conclusions may not align with the generated
reasoning chain. To address this issue, some studies employ the approach of
propositional logic to further enhance logical reasoning abilities of LLMs.
However, the potential omissions in the extraction of logical expressions in
these methods can cause information loss in the logical reasoning process,
thereby generating incorrect results. To this end, we propose Logic-of-Thought
(LoT) prompting which employs propositional logic to generate expanded logical
information from input context, and utilizes the generated logical information
as an additional augmentation to the input prompts, thereby enhancing the
capability of logical reasoning. The LoT is orthogonal to existing prompting
methods and can be seamlessly integrated with them. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that LoT boosts the performance of various prompting methods with a
striking margin across five logical reasoning tasks. In particular, the LoT
enhances Chain-of-Thought's performance on the ReClor dataset by +4.35%;
moreover, it improves Chain-of-Thought with Self-Consistency's performance on
LogiQA by +5%; additionally, it boosts performance of Tree-of-Thoughts on

essential. However, state-of-the-art (SOTA) LLMs rarely disclose details about
their pre-training data, making it difficult for researchers to identify ideal

identify the watermarks, and (ii) there is no perceptible degradation in the
output quality for ordinary users. We formalize the security definitions for
MDDW and present a framework for constructing MDDW for any LLM using

Uni-Med: A Unified Medical Generalist Foundation Model For Multi-Task Learning Via Connector-MoE,"Xun Zhu, Ying Hu, Fanbin Mo, Miao Li, Ji Wu","Multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) have shown impressive capabilities
as a general-purpose interface for various visual and linguistic tasks.
However, building a unified MLLM for multi-task learning in the medical field
remains a thorny challenge. To mitigate the tug-of-war problem of multi-modal
multi-task optimization, recent advances primarily focus on improving the LLM
components, while neglecting the connector that bridges the gap between
modalities. In this paper, we introduce Uni-Med, a novel medical generalist
foundation model which consists of a universal visual feature extraction
module, a connector mixture-of-experts (CMoE) module, and an LLM. Benefiting
from the proposed CMoE that leverages a well-designed router with a mixture of
projection experts at the connector, Uni-Med achieves efficient solution to the
tug-of-war problem and can perform six different medical tasks including
question answering, visual question answering, report generation, referring
expression comprehension, referring expression generation and image
classification. To the best of our knowledge, Uni-Med is the first effort to
tackle multi-task interference at the connector. Extensive ablation experiments
validate the effectiveness of introducing CMoE under any configuration, with up
to an average 8% performance gains. We further provide interpretation analysis

HaloScope: Harnessing Unlabeled LLM Generations for Hallucination Detection,"Xuefeng Du, Chaowei Xiao, Yixuan Li","The surge in applications of large language models (LLMs) has prompted
concerns about the generation of misleading or fabricated information, known as

particularly limited by the availability and quality of datasets. Furthermore,
current research mainly focuses on the spatial-temporal travel pattern but
lacks an understanding of the semantic information between activities, which is
crucial for modeling the interdependence between activities. In this paper, we

MaskLLM: Learnable Semi-Structured Sparsity for Large Language Models,"Gongfan Fang, Hongxu Yin, Saurav Muralidharan, Greg Heinrich, Jeff Pool, Jan Kautz, Pavlo Molchanov, Xinchao Wang","Large Language Models (LLMs) are distinguished by their massive parameter
counts, which typically result in significant redundancy. This work introduces
MaskLLM, a learnable pruning method that establishes Semi-structured (or
``N:M'') Sparsity in LLMs, aimed at reducing computational overhead during
inference. Instead of developing a new importance criterion, MaskLLM explicitly
models N:M patterns as a learnable distribution through Gumbel Softmax
sampling. This approach facilitates end-to-end training on large-scale datasets
and offers two notable advantages: 1) High-quality Masks - our method
effectively scales to large datasets and learns accurate masks; 2)
Transferability - the probabilistic modeling of mask distribution enables the
transfer learning of sparsity across domains or tasks. We assessed MaskLLM
using 2:4 sparsity on various LLMs, including LLaMA-2, Nemotron-4, and GPT-3,
with sizes ranging from 843M to 15B parameters, and our empirical results show
substantial improvements over state-of-the-art methods. For instance, leading
approaches achieve a perplexity (PPL) of 10 or greater on Wikitext compared to
the dense model's 5.12 PPL, but MaskLLM achieves a significantly lower 6.72 PPL
solely by learning the masks with frozen weights. Furthermore, MaskLLM's
learnable nature allows customized masks for lossless application of 2:4

RED QUEEN: Safeguarding Large Language Models against Concealed Multi-Turn Jailbreaking,"Yifan Jiang, Kriti Aggarwal, Tanmay Laud, Kashif Munir, Jay Pujara, Subhabrata Mukherjee","The rapid progress of Large Language Models (LLMs) has opened up new
opportunities across various domains and applications; yet it also presents
challenges related to potential misuse. To mitigate such risks, red teaming has
been employed as a proactive security measure to probe language models for
harmful outputs via jailbreak attacks. However, current jailbreak attack
approaches are single-turn with explicit malicious queries that do not fully
capture the complexity of real-world interactions. In reality, users can engage
in multi-turn interactions with LLM-based chat assistants, allowing them to
conceal their true intentions in a more covert manner. To bridge this gap, we,
first, propose a new jailbreak approach, RED QUEEN ATTACK. This method
constructs a multi-turn scenario, concealing the malicious intent under the
guise of preventing harm. We craft 40 scenarios that vary in turns and select
14 harmful categories to generate 56k multi-turn attack data points. We conduct
comprehensive experiments on the RED QUEEN ATTACK with four representative LLM
families of different sizes. Our experiments reveal that all LLMs are
vulnerable to RED QUEEN ATTACK, reaching 87.62% attack success rate on GPT-4o
and 75.4% on Llama3-70B. Further analysis reveals that larger models are more
susceptible to the RED QUEEN ATTACK, with multi-turn structures and concealment
strategies contributing to its success. To prioritize safety, we introduce a
straightforward mitigation strategy called RED QUEEN GUARD, which aligns LLMs
to effectively counter adversarial attacks. This approach reduces the attack
success rate to below 1% while maintaining the model's performance across
standard benchmarks. Full implementation and dataset are publicly accessible at

performance on complex reasoning problems requiring multi-step thinking and
combining various skills is still limited. To address this, we propose a novel
framework HDFlow for complex reasoning with LLMs that combines fast and slow
thinking modes in an adaptive manner. Our approach consists of two key
components: 1) a new approach for slow, deliberate reasoning called Dynamic
Workflow, which automatically decomposes complex problems into more manageable
sub-tasks and dynamically designs a workflow to assemble specialized LLM or
symbolic reasoning tools to solve sub-tasks; 2) Hybrid Thinking, a general
framework that dynamically combines fast and slow thinking based on problem
complexity. Finally, we propose an easy-to-scale method for automatically
synthesizing a large-scale dataset of 27K challenging reasoning problems for
complex reasoning and a hybrid thinking tuning method that trains smaller LLMs
on this dataset to internalize the fast/slow hybrid reasoning strategies.
Experiments on four reasoning benchmark datasets demonstrate that our slow

hybrid thinking achieves the highest accuracy while providing an effective
balance between computational efficiency and performance. Fine-tuning using our
hybrid thinking approach also significantly boosts the complex reasoning

handling long context inputs, but this comes at the cost of increased
computational resources and latency. Our research introduces a novel approach
for the long context bottleneck to accelerate LLM inference and reduce GPU
memory consumption. Our research demonstrates that LLMs can identify relevant
tokens in the early layers before generating answers to a query. Leveraging
this insight, we propose an algorithm that uses early layers of an LLM as
filters to select and compress input tokens, significantly reducing the context
length for subsequent processing. Our method, GemFilter, demonstrates
substantial improvements in both speed and memory efficiency compared to
existing techniques, such as standard attention and SnapKV/H2O. Notably, it
achieves a 2.4$\times$ speedup and 30\% reduction in GPU memory usage compared

From Deception to Detection: The Dual Roles of Large Language Models in Fake News,"Dorsaf Sallami, Yuan-Chen Chang, Esma Aïmeur","Fake news poses a significant threat to the integrity of information
ecosystems and public trust. The advent of Large Language Models (LLMs) holds
considerable promise for transforming the battle against fake news. Generally,
LLMs represent a double-edged sword in this struggle. One major concern is that
LLMs can be readily used to craft and disseminate misleading information on a
large scale. This raises the pressing questions: Can LLMs easily generate
biased fake news? Do all LLMs have this capability? Conversely, LLMs offer
valuable prospects for countering fake news, thanks to their extensive
knowledge of the world and robust reasoning capabilities. This leads to other
critical inquiries: Can we use LLMs to detect fake news, and do they outperform
typical detection models? In this paper, we aim to address these pivotal
questions by exploring the performance of various LLMs. Our objective is to
explore the capability of various LLMs in effectively combating fake news,
marking this as the first investigation to analyze seven such models. Our
results reveal that while some models adhere strictly to safety protocols,
refusing to generate biased or misleading content, other models can readily
produce fake news across a spectrum of biases. Additionally, our results show
that larger models generally exhibit superior detection abilities and that
LLM-generated fake news are less likely to be detected than human-written ones.

Post-hoc Reward Calibration: A Case Study on Length Bias,"Zeyu Huang, Zihan Qiu, Zili Wang, Edoardo M. Ponti, Ivan Titov","Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback aligns the outputs of Large
Language Models with human values and preferences. Central to this process is
the reward model (RM), which translates human feedback into training signals
for optimising LLM behaviour. However, RMs can develop biases by exploiting
spurious correlations in their training data, such as favouring outputs based
on length or style rather than true quality. These biases can lead to incorrect
output rankings, sub-optimal model evaluations, and the amplification of
undesirable behaviours in LLMs alignment. This paper addresses the challenge of
correcting such biases without additional data and training, introducing the
concept of Post-hoc Reward Calibration. We first propose an intuitive approach
to estimate the bias term and, thus, remove it to approximate the underlying
true reward. We then extend the approach to a more general and robust form with
the Locally Weighted Regression. Focusing on the prevalent length bias, we
validate our proposed approaches across three experimental settings,
demonstrating consistent improvements: (1) a 3.11 average performance gain
across 33 reward models on the RewardBench dataset; (2) enhanced alignment of
RM rankings with GPT-4 evaluations and human preferences based on the

process in multiple LLM--RM combinations. Our method is computationally
efficient and generalisable to other types of bias and RMs, offering a scalable

Scaling Behavior for Large Language Models regarding Numeral Systems: An Example using Pythia,"Zhejian Zhou, Jiayu Wang, Dahua Lin, Kai Chen","Though Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown remarkable abilities in
mathematics reasoning, they are still struggling with performing numeric
operations accurately, such as addition and multiplication. Numbers can be
tokenized into tokens in various ways by different LLMs and affect the numeric
operations performance. Currently, there are two representatives: 1) Tokenize
into $1$-digit, and 2) Tokenize into $1\sim 3$ digit. The difference is roughly
equivalent to using different numeral systems (namely base $10$ or base
$10^{3}$). In light of this, we study the scaling behavior of different numeral
systems in the context of transformer-based large language models. We
empirically show that a base $10$ system is consistently more data-efficient
than a base $10^{2}$ or $10^{3}$ system across training data scale, model sizes
under from-scratch training settings, while different number systems have very
similar fine-tuning performances. We attribute this to higher token frequencies
of a base $10$ system. Additionally, we reveal extrapolation behavior patterns
on addition and multiplication. We identify that base $100$ and base $1000$
systems struggle on token-level discernment and token-level operations. We also
sheds light on the mechanism learnt by the models.",2024-09-25 22:08:31+00:00,cs.CL,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.17391v2,Scaling_Behavior_for_Large_Language_Models_regarding_Numeral_Systems_An_Example_using_Pythia
Search for Efficient Large Language Models,"Xuan Shen, Pu Zhao, Yifan Gong, Zhenglun Kong, Zheng Zhan, Yushu Wu, Ming Lin, Chao Wu, Xue Lin, Yanzhi Wang","Large Language Models (LLMs) have long held sway in the realms of artificial
intelligence research. Numerous efficient techniques, including weight pruning,
quantization, and distillation, have been embraced to compress LLMs, targeting
memory reduction and inference acceleration, which underscore the redundancy in
LLMs. However, most model compression techniques concentrate on weight
optimization, overlooking the exploration of optimal architectures. Besides,
traditional architecture search methods, limited by the elevated complexity
with extensive parameters, struggle to demonstrate their effectiveness on LLMs.
In this paper, we propose a training-free architecture search framework to
identify optimal subnets that preserve the fundamental strengths of the
original LLMs while achieving inference acceleration. Furthermore, after
generating subnets that inherit specific weights from the original LLMs, we
introduce a reformation algorithm that utilizes the omitted weights to rectify
the inherited weights with a small amount of calibration data. Compared with

speech into text for processing before generating audio responses, which
introduces latency and loses audio features. We propose a method that
implicitly internalizes ASR chain of thought into a speech LLM, enhancing its
native speech understanding capabilities. Our approach reduces latency and

Attention Prompting on Image for Large Vision-Language Models,"Runpeng Yu, Weihao Yu, Xinchao Wang","Compared with Large Language Models (LLMs), Large Vision-Language Models

emergent capabilities and demonstrating impressive performance on various
vision-language tasks. Motivated by text prompting in LLMs, visual prompting
has been explored to enhance LVLMs' capabilities of perceiving visual
information. However, previous visual prompting techniques solely process
visual inputs without considering text queries, limiting the models' ability to
follow text instructions to complete tasks. To fill this gap, in this work, we
propose a new prompting technique named Attention Prompting on Image, which
just simply overlays a text-query-guided attention heatmap on the original

generate an attention heatmap for the input image dependent on the text query
with an auxiliary model like CLIP. Then the heatmap simply multiplies the pixel
values of the original image to obtain the actual input image for the LVLM.

with compression, it is surprising that modern LLMs are not employed in
practical text compression systems. In this paper, we provide an in-depth
analysis of neural network and transformer-based compression techniques to

neural network and LLM-based text compression methods. Although LLM-based
systems significantly outperform conventional compression methods, they are
highly impractical. Specifically, LLMZip, a recent text compression system

Programming Every Example: Lifting Pre-training Data Quality like Experts at Scale,"Fan Zhou, Zengzhi Wang, Qian Liu, Junlong Li, Pengfei Liu","Large language model pre-training has traditionally relied on human experts
to craft heuristics for improving the corpora quality, resulting in numerous
rules developed to date. However, these rules lack the flexibility to address
the unique characteristics of individual example effectively. Meanwhile,
applying tailored rules to every example is impractical for human experts. In
this paper, we demonstrate that even small language models, with as few as 0.3B
parameters, can exhibit substantial data refining capabilities comparable to
those of human experts. We introduce Programming Every Example (ProX), a novel
framework that treats data refinement as a programming task, enabling models to
refine corpora by generating and executing fine-grained operations, such as
string normalization, for each individual example at scale. Experimental
results show that models pre-trained on ProX-curated data outperform either
original data or data filtered by other selection methods by more than 2%
across various downstream benchmarks. Its effectiveness spans various model
sizes and pre-training corpora, including C4, RedPajama-V2, and FineWeb.
Furthermore, ProX exhibits significant potential in domain-specific continual
pre-training: without domain specific design, models trained on OpenWebMath
refined by ProX outperform human-crafted rule-based methods, improving average
accuracy by 7.6% over Mistral-7B, with 14.6% for Llama-2-7B and 20.3% for

techniques become increasingly more expensive, which has motivated the recent
surge in post-training quantization (PTQ) research. To the best of our
knowledge, ours marks the first formal study of accumulator-aware quantization
in the PTQ setting. To bridge this gap, we introduce AXE, a practical framework

VPTQ: Extreme Low-bit Vector Post-Training Quantization for Large Language Models,"Yifei Liu, Jicheng Wen, Yang Wang, Shengyu Ye, Li Lyna Zhang, Ting Cao, Cheng Li, Mao Yang","Scaling model size significantly challenges the deployment and inference of
Large Language Models (LLMs). Due to the redundancy in LLM weights, recent
research has focused on pushing weight-only quantization to extremely low-bit
(even down to 2 bits). It reduces memory requirements, optimizes storage costs,
and decreases memory bandwidth needs during inference. However, due to
numerical representation limitations, traditional scalar-based weight
quantization struggles to achieve such extreme low-bit. Recent research on
Vector Quantization (VQ) for LLMs has demonstrated the potential for extremely
low-bit model quantization by compressing vectors into indices using lookup
tables.
  In this paper, we introduce Vector Post-Training Quantization (VPTQ) for
extremely low-bit quantization of LLMs. We use Second-Order Optimization to
formulate the LLM VQ problem and guide our quantization algorithm design by
solving the optimization. We further refine the weights using
Channel-Independent Second-Order Optimization for a granular VQ. In addition,
by decomposing the optimization problem, we propose a brief and effective
codebook initialization algorithm. We also extend VPTQ to support residual and
outlier quantization, which enhances model accuracy and further compresses the
model. Our experimental results show that VPTQ reduces model quantization
perplexity by $0.01$-$0.34$ on LLaMA-2, $0.38$-$0.68$ on Mistral-7B,
$4.41$-$7.34$ on LLaMA-3 over SOTA at 2-bit, with an average accuracy
improvement of $0.79$-$1.5\%$ on LLaMA-2, $1\%$ on Mistral-7B, $11$-$22\%$ on

Using LLM for Real-Time Transcription and Summarization of Doctor-Patient Interactions into ePuskesmas in Indonesia,"Azmul Asmar Irfan, Nur Ahmad Khatim, Mansur M. Arief","One of the key issues contributing to inefficiency in Puskesmas is the
time-consuming nature of doctor-patient interactions. Doctors need to conduct
thorough consultations, which include diagnosing the patient's condition,
providing treatment advice, and transcribing detailed notes into medical

ask clarifying questions, further prolonging the process. While diagnosing is
essential, transcription and summarization can often be automated using AI to
improve time efficiency and help doctors enhance care quality and enable early
diagnosis and intervention. This paper proposes a solution using a localized
large language model (LLM) to transcribe, translate, and summarize
doctor-patient conversations. We utilize the Whisper model for transcription
and GPT-3 to summarize them into the ePuskemas medical records format. This
system is implemented as an add-on to an existing web browser extension,
allowing doctors to fill out patient forms while talking. By leveraging this
solution for real-time transcription, translation, and summarization, doctors
can improve the turnaround time for patient care while enhancing the quality of
records, which become more detailed and insightful for future visits. This
innovation addresses challenges like overcrowded facilities and the

Harnessing Diversity for Important Data Selection in Pretraining Large Language Models,"Chi Zhang, Huaping Zhong, Kuan Zhang, Chengliang Chai, Rui Wang, Xinlin Zhuang, Tianyi Bai, Jiantao Qiu, Lei Cao, Ye Yuan, Guoren Wang, Conghui He","Data selection is of great significance in pre-training large language
models, given the variation in quality within the large-scale available

use of data influence to measure the importance of data instances, $i.e.,$ a
high influence score indicates that incorporating this instance to the training
set is likely to enhance the model performance. Consequently, they select the
top-$k$ instances with the highest scores. However, this approach has several
limitations. (1) Computing the influence of all available data is
time-consuming. (2) The selected data instances are not diverse enough, which

ability to evaluate the influence of data, $i.e.,$ its quality. For the
diversity, \texttt{Quad} clusters the dataset into similar data instances
within each cluster and diverse instances across different clusters. For each
cluster, if we opt to select data from it, we take some samples to evaluate the
influence to prevent processing all instances. To determine which clusters to

continues to be a challenge. Traditional metrics like ROUGE and BLEU show a
weak correlation with human judgment. More sophisticated metrics using Natural
Language Inference (NLI) have shown improved correlations but are complex to
implement, require domain-specific training due to poor cross-domain
generalization, and lack explainability. More recently, prompt-based metrics
using LLMs as evaluators have emerged; while they are easier to implement, they
still lack explainability and depend on task-specific prompts, which limits
their generalizability. This work introduces Automated eXplainable Consistency
Evaluation using LLMs (AXCEL), a prompt-based consistency metric which offers
explanations for the consistency scores by providing detailed reasoning and
pinpointing inconsistent text spans. AXCEL is also a generalizable metric which
can be adopted to multiple tasks without changing the prompt. AXCEL outperforms
both non-prompt and prompt-based state-of-the-art (SOTA) metrics in detecting
inconsistencies across summarization by 8.7%, free text generation by 6.2%, and
data-to-text conversion tasks by 29.4%. We also evaluate the influence of
underlying LLMs on prompt based metric performance and recalibrate the SOTA
prompt-based metrics with the latest LLMs for fair comparison. Further, we show
that AXCEL demonstrates strong performance using open source LLMs.",2024-09-25 14:45:52+00:00,cs.AI,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.16984v1,AXCEL_Automated_eXplainable_Consistency_Evaluation_using_LLMs

significant challenge, particularly in on-device applications. Traditional
methods often depend heavily on labeled datasets and can be resource-intensive.
To address these issues, we present Adaptive Self-Supervised Learning
Strategies (ASLS), which utilizes self-supervised learning techniques to
personalize LLMs dynamically. The framework comprises a user profiling layer
for collecting interaction data and a neural adaptation layer for real-time
model fine-tuning. This innovative approach enables continuous learning from
user feedback, allowing the model to generate responses that align closely with
user-specific contexts. The adaptive mechanisms of ASLS minimize computational
demands and enhance personalization efficiency. Experimental results across
various user scenarios illustrate the superior performance of ASLS in boosting
user engagement and satisfaction, highlighting its potential to redefine LLMs

Semi-Supervised Cognitive State Classification from Speech with Multi-View Pseudo-Labeling,"Yuanchao Li, Zixing Zhang, Jing Han, Peter Bell, Catherine Lai","The lack of labeled data is a common challenge in speech classification
tasks, particularly those requiring extensive subjective assessment, such as
cognitive state classification. In this work, we propose a Semi-Supervised
Learning (SSL) framework, introducing a novel multi-view pseudo-labeling method
that leverages both acoustic and linguistic characteristics to select the most
confident data for training the classification model. Acoustically, unlabeled
data are compared to labeled data using the Frechet audio distance, calculated
from embeddings generated by multiple audio encoders. Linguistically, large
language models are prompted to revise automatic speech recognition
transcriptions and predict labels based on our proposed task-specific
knowledge. High-confidence data are identified when pseudo-labels from both
sources align, while mismatches are treated as low-confidence data. A bimodal
classifier is then trained to iteratively label the low-confidence data until a
predefined criterion is met. We evaluate our SSL framework on emotion
recognition and dementia detection tasks. Experimental results demonstrate that
our method achieves competitive performance compared to fully supervised
learning using only 30% of the labeled data and significantly outperforms two

Zero-Shot Detection of LLM-Generated Text using Token Cohesiveness,"Shixuan Ma, Quan Wang","The increasing capability and widespread usage of large language models
(LLMs) highlight the desirability of automatic detection of LLM-generated text.
Zero-shot detectors, due to their training-free nature, have received
considerable attention and notable success. In this paper, we identify a new
feature, token cohesiveness, that is useful for zero-shot detection, and we
demonstrate that LLM-generated text tends to exhibit higher token cohesiveness
than human-written text. Based on this observation, we devise TOCSIN, a generic
dual-channel detection paradigm that uses token cohesiveness as a plug-and-play
module to improve existing zero-shot detectors. To calculate token
cohesiveness, TOCSIN only requires a few rounds of random token deletion and
semantic difference measurement, making it particularly suitable for a
practical black-box setting where the source model used for generation is not
accessible. Extensive experiments with four state-of-the-art base detectors on
various datasets, source models, and evaluation settings demonstrate the
effectiveness and generality of the proposed approach. Code available at:

Pruning Multilingual Large Language Models for Multilingual Inference,"Hwichan Kim, Jun Suzuki, Tosho Hirasawa, Mamoru Komachi","Multilingual large language models (MLLMs), trained on multilingual balanced
data, demonstrate better zero-shot learning performance in non-English
languages compared to large language models trained on English-dominant data.
However, the disparity in performance between English and non-English languages
remains a challenge yet to be fully addressed. A distinctive characteristic of
MLLMs is their high-quality translation capabilities, indicating an acquired
proficiency in aligning between languages. This study explores how to enhance
the zero-shot performance of MLLMs in non-English languages by leveraging their
alignment capability between English and non-English languages. To achieve
this, we first analyze the behavior of MLLMs when performing translation and
reveal that there are large magnitude features that play a critical role in the
translation process. Inspired by these findings, we retain the weights
associated with operations involving the large magnitude features and prune
other weights to force MLLMs to rely on these features for tasks beyond
translation. We empirically demonstrate that this pruning strategy can enhance
the MLLMs' performance in non-English language.",2024-09-25 13:15:50+00:00,cs.CL,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.16911v1,Pruning_Multilingual_Large_Language_Models_for_Multilingual_Inference
Enhancing Temporal Sensitivity and Reasoning for Time-Sensitive Question Answering,"Wanqi Yang, Yanda Li, Meng Fang, Ling Chen","Time-Sensitive Question Answering (TSQA) demands the effective utilization of
specific temporal contexts, encompassing multiple time-evolving facts, to
address time-sensitive questions. This necessitates not only the parsing of
temporal information within questions but also the identification and
understanding of time-evolving facts to generate accurate answers. However,
current large language models still have limited sensitivity to temporal
information and their inadequate temporal reasoning capabilities.In this paper,
we propose a novel framework that enhances temporal awareness and reasoning

transformative paradigm in the robotic field, offering unparalleled
capabilities not only in the communication domain but also in skills like
multimodal input handling, high-level reasoning, and plan generation. The
grounding of LLMs knowledge into the empirical world has been considered a
crucial pathway to exploit the efficiency of LLMs in robotics. Nevertheless,
connecting LLMs' representations to the external world with multimodal
approaches or with robots' bodies is not enough to let them understand the
meaning of the language they are manipulating. Taking inspiration from humans,
this work draws attention to three necessary elements for an agent to grasp and

desirable. Balancing these factors ensures the design of a framework that
addresses its trade-offs, such as balancing performance against explainability.
A successful framework provides practical advice for businesses to meet
regulatory requirements in sectors such as finance and healthcare, where it is
critical to comply with standards like GPDR and the EU AI Act. Different case
studies validate this framework by integrating AI in both academic and
practical environments. For instance, large language models are cost-effective
alternatives for generating synthetic opinions that emulate attitudes to
environmental issues. These case studies demonstrate how having a structured
framework could enhance transparency and maintain performance levels as shown
from the alignment between synthetic and expected distributions. This alignment
is quantified using metrics like Chi-test scores, normalized mutual

Multi-objective Evolution of Heuristic Using Large Language Model,"Shunyu Yao, Fei Liu, Xi Lin, Zhichao Lu, Zhenkun Wang, Qingfu Zhang","Heuristics are commonly used to tackle diverse search and optimization
problems. Design heuristics usually require tedious manual crafting with domain
knowledge. Recent works have incorporated large language models (LLMs) into
automatic heuristic search leveraging their powerful language and coding
capacity. However, existing research focuses on the optimal performance on the
target problem as the sole objective, neglecting other criteria such as
efficiency and scalability, which are vital in practice. To tackle this
challenge, we propose to model heuristic search as a multi-objective
optimization problem and consider introducing other practical criteria beyond
optimal performance. Due to the complexity of the search space, conventional
multi-objective optimization methods struggle to effectively handle
multi-objective heuristic search. We propose the first LLM-based
multi-objective heuristic search framework, Multi-objective Evolution of
Heuristic (MEoH), which integrates LLMs in a zero-shot manner to generate a
non-dominated set of heuristics to meet multiple design criteria. We design a
new dominance-dissimilarity mechanism for effective population management and
selection, which incorporates both code dissimilarity in the search space and
dominance in the objective space. MEoH is demonstrated in two well-known
combinatorial optimization problems: the online Bin Packing Problem (BPP) and
the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP). Results indicate that a variety of elite
heuristics are automatically generated in a single run, offering more trade-off
options than existing methods. It successfully achieves competitive or superior
performance while improving efficiency up to 10 times. Moreover, we also
observe that the multi-objective search introduces novel insights into
heuristic design and leads to the discovery of diverse heuristics.",2024-09-25 12:32:41+00:00,cs.AI,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.16867v1,Multiobjective_Evolution_of_Heuristic_Using_Large_Language_Model

problem, in this paper, we introduce Multi-Scale Insight Agent (MSI-Agent), an
embodied agent designed to improve LLMs' planning and decision-making ability
by summarizing and utilizing insight effectively across different scales. MSI
achieves this through the experience selector, insight generator, and insight
selector. Leveraging a three-part pipeline, MSI can generate task-specific and
high-level insight, store it in a database, and then use relevant insight from
it to aid in decision-making. Our experiments show that MSI outperforms another
insight strategy when planning by GPT3.5. Moreover, We delve into the
strategies for selecting seed experience and insight, aiming to provide LLM
with more useful and relevant insight for better decision-making. Our
observations also indicate that MSI exhibits better robustness when facing
domain-shifting scenarios.",2024-09-25 07:21:51+00:00,cs.AI,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.16686v1,MSIAgent_Incorporating_MultiScale_Insight_into_Embodied_Agents_for_Superior_Planning_and_DecisionMaking
SynTQA: Synergistic Table-based Question Answering via Mixture of Text-to-SQL and E2E TQA,"Siyue Zhang, Anh Tuan Luu, Chen Zhao","Text-to-SQL parsing and end-to-end question answering (E2E TQA) are two main
approaches for Table-based Question Answering task. Despite success on multiple

In this paper, we identify different strengths and weaknesses through
evaluating state-of-the-art models on benchmark datasets: Text-to-SQL
demonstrates superiority in handling questions involving arithmetic operations
and long tables; E2E TQA excels in addressing ambiguous questions, non-standard
table schema, and complex table contents. To combine both strengths, we propose

GraphLoRA: Structure-Aware Contrastive Low-Rank Adaptation for Cross-Graph Transfer Learning,"Zhe-Rui Yang, Jindong Han, Chang-Dong Wang, Hao Liu","Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have demonstrated remarkable proficiency in
handling a range of graph analytical tasks across various domains, such as
e-commerce and social networks. Despite their versatility, GNNs face
significant challenges in transferability, limiting their utility in real-world
applications. Existing research in GNN transfer learning overlooks
discrepancies in distribution among various graph datasets, facing challenges
when transferring across different distributions. How to effectively adopt a
well-trained GNN to new graphs with varying feature and structural
distributions remains an under-explored problem. Taking inspiration from the
success of Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) in adapting large language models to
various domains, we propose GraphLoRA, an effective and parameter-efficient
method for transferring well-trained GNNs to diverse graph domains.
Specifically, we first propose a Structure-aware Maximum Mean Discrepancy
(SMMD) to align divergent node feature distributions across source and target
graphs. Moreover, we introduce low-rank adaptation by injecting a small
trainable GNN alongside the pre-trained one, effectively bridging structural
distribution gaps while mitigating the catastrophic forgetting. Additionally, a
structure-aware regularization objective is proposed to enhance the
adaptability of the pre-trained GNN to target graph with scarce supervision
labels. Extensive experiments on six real-world datasets demonstrate the
effectiveness of GraphLoRA against eleven baselines by tuning only 20% of

A Character-Centric Creative Story Generation via Imagination,"Kyeongman Park, Minbeom Kim, Kyomin Jung","Creative story generation with diverse and detailed story elements is a
long-standing goal for large language models. While existing methodologies
generate long and coherent stories, they fall significantly short of human
capabilities in terms of diversity and character detail. To address this, we
introduce a novel story generation framework called CCI (Character-centric
Creative story generation via Imagination). CCI features two innovative modules
for creative story generation: IG (Image-Guided Imagination) and MW
(Multi-Writer model). In the IG module, we utilize DALL-E 3 to create visual
representations of key story elements. The IG generates more novel and concrete
characters, backgrounds, and main plots than text-only methods. The MW module
uses these story elements created by IG to generate multiple description
candidates for the protagonist and select the best one. This method
incorporates vivid and rich character descriptions into the story. We compared
the stories generated by CCI and baseline models through human evaluation and
statistical analysis. The results showed significant improvements in the
creativity. Furthermore, by enabling interactive multi-modal story generation

Judgment of Thoughts: Courtroom of the Binary Logical Reasoning in Large Language Models,"Sungjune Park, Daeseon Choi","This paper proposes a novel prompt engineering technique called Judgment of
Thought (JoT) that is specifically tailored for binary logical reasoning tasks.
JoT employs three roles$\unicode{x2014}$lawyer, prosecutor, and

model. In this framework, the judge utilizes a high$\unicode{x2010}$level

few-shot learning with an 137B LLM. In this paper, we challenge a trend
equating query and question, and instead conceptualize query generation task as
a ""compilation"" of high-level intent into task-adaptive query. Specifically, we

Dynamic-Width Speculative Beam Decoding for Efficient LLM Inference,"Zongyue Qin, Zifan He, Neha Prakriya, Jason Cong, Yizhou Sun","Large language models (LLMs) have shown outstanding performance across
numerous real-world tasks. However, the autoregressive nature of these models
makes the inference process slow and costly. Speculative decoding has emerged
as a promising solution, leveraging a smaller auxiliary model to draft future
tokens, which are then validated simultaneously by the larger model, achieving
a speed-up of 1-2x. Although speculative decoding matches the same distribution
as multinomial sampling, multinomial sampling itself is prone to suboptimal
outputs, whereas beam sampling is widely recognized for producing
higher-quality results by maintaining multiple candidate sequences at each
step. This paper explores the novel integration of speculative decoding with
beam sampling. However, there are four key challenges: (1) how to generate
multiple sequences from the larger model's distribution given drafts sequences
from the small model; (2) how to dynamically optimize the number of beams to
balance efficiency and accuracy; (3) how to efficiently verify the multiple
drafts in parallel; and (4) how to address the extra memory costs inherent in
beam sampling. To address these challenges, we propose dynamic-width
speculative beam decoding (DSBD). Specifically, we first introduce a novel
draft and verification scheme that generates multiple sequences following the
large model's distribution based on beam sampling trajectories from the small
model. Then, we introduce an adaptive mechanism to dynamically tune the number
of beams based on the context, optimizing efficiency and effectiveness.

"Strategies for Improving NL-to-FOL Translation with LLMs: Data Generation, Incremental Fine-Tuning, and Verification","Ramya Keerthy Thatikonda, Jiuzhou Han, Wray Buntine, Ehsan Shareghi","Logical reasoning is a fundamental task in natural language processing that
presents significant challenges to Large Language Models (LLMs). The inherent
characteristics of logical reasoning makes it well-suited for symbolic
representations such as first-order logic (FOL). Research in symbolic logical
reasoning explored FOL generation using state-of-the-art LLMs (i.e., GPT-4) to
produce FOL translations of natural language (NL) statements, but errors in
translation are usually not the focus. We address this by categorizing the
translation errors in FOL statements generated by LLMs. To make progress
towards improving the quality of FOL translations for smaller language models
such as LLaMA-2 13B and Mistral 7B, we create ProofFOL, a high-quality
FOL-annotated subset of ProofWriter dataset using GPT-4o. The models fine-tuned
on this silver standard data achieve a significant gain in performance when
compared to larger language models such as LLaMA-2 70B. In addition to
improving the model using large data, we also tackle the issue of data scarcity
and introduce an incremental framework encompassing of data augmentation and
verification steps. In the augmentation process, a single pair of (premises,
conclusion) is split into multiple new instances based on the predicates and
FOLs. This data is used for fine-tuning, and the inference on this model
generates FOLs with fewer errors over the model trained on the original data.
Our investigation on the translation errors leads to generation of a
perturbation dataset, which is used to train a verifier that corrects potential
syntactic and semantic FOL translation errors. We demonstrate an efficient
method for making the most of a limited existing human-annotated dataset. Our

and tools, leading to increased interactional safety risks. We present
HAICOSYSTEM, a framework examining AI agent safety within diverse and complex
social interactions. HAICOSYSTEM features a modular sandbox environment that
simulates multi-turn interactions between human users and AI agents, where the
AI agents are equipped with a variety of tools (e.g., patient management
platforms) to navigate diverse scenarios (e.g., a user attempting to access
other patients' profiles). To examine the safety of AI agents in these
interactions, we develop a comprehensive multi-dimensional evaluation framework
that uses metrics covering operational, content-related, societal, and legal
risks. Through running 1840 simulations based on 92 scenarios across seven
domains (e.g., healthcare, finance, education), we demonstrate that HAICOSYSTEM

Task-oriented Prompt Enhancement via Script Generation,"Chung-Yu Wang, Alireza DaghighFarsoodeh, Hung Viet Pham","Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable abilities across
various tasks, leveraging advanced reasoning. Yet, they struggle with
task-oriented prompts due to a lack of specific prior knowledge of the task
answers. The current state-of-the-art approach, PAL, utilizes code generation
to address this issue. However, PAL depends on manually crafted prompt
templates and examples while still producing inaccurate results. In this work,
we present TITAN-a novel strategy designed to enhance LLMs' performance on
task-oriented prompts. TITAN achieves this by generating scripts using a
universal approach and zero-shot learning. Unlike existing methods, TITAN
eliminates the need for detailed task-specific instructions and extensive
manual efforts. TITAN enhances LLMs' performance on various tasks by utilizing
their analytical and code-generation capabilities in a streamlined process.
TITAN employs two key techniques: (1) step-back prompting to extract the task's
input specifications and (2) chain-of-thought prompting to identify required
procedural steps. This information is used to improve the LLMs' code-generation
process. TITAN further refines the generated script through post-processing and
the script is executed to retrieve the final answer. Our comprehensive
evaluation demonstrates TITAN's effectiveness in a diverse set of tasks. On
average, TITAN outperforms the state-of-the-art zero-shot approach by 7.6% and
3.9% when paired with GPT-3.5 and GPT-4. Overall, without human annotation,
TITAN achieves state-of-the-art performance in 8 out of 11 cases while only
marginally losing to few-shot approaches (which needed human intervention) on
three occasions by small margins. This work represents a significant
advancement in addressing task-oriented prompts, offering a novel solution for
effectively utilizing LLMs in everyday life tasks.",2024-09-24 19:32:08+00:00,cs.SE,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.16418v1,Taskoriented_Prompt_Enhancement_via_Script_Generation
Selection of Prompt Engineering Techniques for Code Generation through Predicting Code Complexity,"Chung-Yu Wang, Alireza DaghighFarsoodeh, Hung Viet Pham","Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive performance in
software engineering tasks. However, improving their accuracy in generating
correct and reliable code remains challenging. Numerous prompt engineering
techniques (PETs) have been developed to address this, but no single approach
is universally optimal. Selecting the right PET for each query is difficult for
two primary reasons: (1) interactive prompting techniques may not consistently
deliver the expected benefits, especially for simpler queries, and (2) current
automated prompt engineering methods lack adaptability and fail to fully
utilize multi-stage responses. To overcome these challenges, we propose
PET-Select, a PET-agnostic selection model that uses code complexity as a proxy
to classify queries and select the most appropriate PET. By incorporating
contrastive learning, PET-Select effectively distinguishes between simple and
complex problems, allowing it to choose PETs that are best suited for each
query's complexity level. Our evaluations on the MBPP and HumanEval benchmarks
using GPT-3.5 Turbo and GPT-4o show up to a 1.9% improvement in pass@1
accuracy, along with a 74.8% reduction in token usage. Additionally, we provide
both quantitative and qualitative results to demonstrate how PET-Select

Merging LoRAs like Playing LEGO: Pushing the Modularity of LoRA to Extremes Through Rank-Wise Clustering,"Ziyu Zhao, Tao Shen, Didi Zhu, Zexi Li, Jing Su, Xuwu Wang, Kun Kuang, Fei Wu","Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) has emerged as a popular technique for fine-tuning
large language models (LLMs) to various domains due to its modular design and

However, existing methods for LoRA composition primarily focus on task-specific
adaptations that require additional training, and current model merging
techniques often fail to fully leverage LoRA's modular nature, leading to

HA-FGOVD: Highlighting Fine-grained Attributes via Explicit Linear Composition for Open-Vocabulary Object Detection,"Yuqi Ma, Mengyin Liu, Chao Zhu, Xu-Cheng Yin","Open-vocabulary object detection (OVD) models are considered to be Large
Multi-modal Models (LMM), due to their extensive training data and a large
number of parameters. Mainstream OVD models prioritize object coarse-grained
category rather than focus on their fine-grained attributes, e.g., colors or
materials, thus failed to identify objects specified with certain attributes.
However, OVD models are pretrained on large-scale image-text pairs with rich
attribute words, whose latent feature space can represent the global text
feature as a linear composition of fine-grained attribute tokens without
highlighting them. Therefore, we propose in this paper a universal and explicit
approach for frozen mainstream OVD models that boosts their attribute-level
detection capabilities by highlighting fine-grained attributes in explicit
linear space. Firstly, a LLM is leveraged to highlight attribute words within
the input text as a zero-shot prompted task. Secondly, by strategically
adjusting the token masks, the text encoders of OVD models extract both global
text and attribute-specific features, which are then explicitly composited as
two vectors in linear space to form the new attribute-highlighted feature for
detection tasks, where corresponding scalars are hand-crafted or learned to
reweight both two vectors. Notably, these scalars can be seamlessly transferred
among different OVD models, which proves that such an explicit linear
composition is universal. Empirical evaluation on the FG-OVD dataset
demonstrates that our proposed method uniformly improves fine-grained
attribute-level OVD of various mainstream models and achieves new
state-of-the-art performance.",2024-09-24 14:43:14+00:00,cs.CV,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.16136v1,HAFGOVD_Highlighting_Finegrained_Attributes_via_Explicit_Linear_Composition_for_OpenVocabulary_Object_Detection
MOSS: Enabling Code-Driven Evolution and Context Management for AI Agents,"Ming Zhu, Yi Zhou","Developing AI agents powered by large language models (LLMs) faces
significant challenges in achieving true Turing completeness and adaptive,

its runtime context, relying heavily on the LLM's memory, which results in
inefficiencies and limits adaptability. Manual protocol development in sandbox
environments further constrains the agent's autonomous adaptability. Crucially,
achieving consistency in code and context across multi-turn interactions and
ensuring isolation of local variables within each interaction remains an
unsolved problem.
  We introduce MOSS (llM-oriented Operating System Simulation), a novel

dynamic context management system. MOSS ensures consistency and adaptability by
using a mechanism that maintains the Python context across interactions,
including isolation of local variables and preservation of runtime integrity.
At its core, the framework employs an Inversion of Control (IoC) container in
conjunction with decorators to enforce the least knowledge principle, allowing
agents to focus on abstract interfaces rather than concrete implementations.
This facilitates seamless integration of new tools and libraries, enables
runtime instance replacement, and reduces prompt complexity, providing a ""what

AI Can Be Cognitively Biased: An Exploratory Study on Threshold Priming in LLM-Based Batch Relevance Assessment,"Nuo Chen, Jiqun Liu, Xiaoyu Dong, Qijiong Liu, Tetsuya Sakai, Xiao-Ming Wu","Cognitive biases are systematic deviations in thinking that lead to
irrational judgments and problematic decision-making, extensively studied
across various fields. Recently, large language models (LLMs) have shown
advanced understanding capabilities but may inherit human biases from their
training data. While social biases in LLMs have been well-studied, cognitive
biases have received less attention, with existing research focusing on
specific scenarios. The broader impact of cognitive biases on LLMs in various
decision-making contexts remains underexplored. We investigated whether LLMs
are influenced by the threshold priming effect in relevance judgments, a core
task and widely-discussed research topic in the Information Retrieval (IR)
coummunity. The priming effect occurs when exposure to certain stimuli
unconsciously affects subsequent behavior and decisions. Our experiment
employed 10 topics from the TREC 2019 Deep Learning passage track collection,
and tested AI judgments under different document relevance scores, batch
lengths, and LLM models, including GPT-3.5, GPT-4, LLaMa2-13B and LLaMa2-70B.
Results showed that LLMs tend to give lower scores to later documents if
earlier ones have high relevance, and vice versa, regardless of the combination
and model used. Our finding demonstrates that LLM%u2019s judgments, similar to
human judgments, are also influenced by threshold priming biases, and suggests
that researchers and system engineers should take into account potential
human-like cognitive biases in designing, evaluating, and auditing LLMs in IR
tasks and beyond.",2024-09-24 12:23:15+00:00,cs.CL,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.16022v1,AI_Can_Be_Cognitively_Biased_An_Exploratory_Study_on_Threshold_Priming_in_LLMBased_Batch_Relevance_Assessment
Bridging Speech and Text: Enhancing ASR with Pinyin-to-Character Pre-training in LLMs,"Yang Yuhang, Peng Yizhou, Eng Siong Chng, Xionghu Zhong","The integration of large language models (LLMs) with pre-trained speech
models has opened up new avenues in automatic speech recognition (ASR). While
LLMs excel in multimodal understanding tasks, effectively leveraging their
capabilities for ASR remains a significant challenge. This paper presents a
novel training approach to enhance LLM performance in ASR tasks. We propose
pre-training LLMs on Pinyin embedding sequences, which represent pronunciation
features, to generate corresponding Chinese characters. This step enables the
LLM to adapt to generating text from pronunciation features before encountering
real speech data. Furthermore, we fine-tune the LoRA parameters to enhance the
LLM's understanding of speech modality information. In AISHELL-1 corpus, our
approach yields a 9.5% relative improvement in ASR tasks compared to the
baseline without Pinyi-to-Character pre-training. Additionally, incorporating
auxiliary text data for Pinyi-to-Character pre-training further boosts
performance, achieving a 19.0% relative improvement.",2024-09-24 12:06:31+00:00,cs.CL,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.16005v1,Bridging_Speech_and_Text_Enhancing_ASR_with_PinyintoCharacter_Pretraining_in_LLMs

Finetuning LLMs for Comparative Assessment Tasks,"Vatsal Raina, Adian Liusie, Mark Gales","Automated assessment in natural language generation is a challenging task.
Instruction-tuned large language models (LLMs) have shown promise in
reference-free evaluation, particularly through comparative assessment.
However, the quadratic computational complexity of pairwise comparisons limits
its scalability. To address this, efficient comparative assessment has been
explored by applying comparative strategies on zero-shot LLM probabilities. We
propose a framework for finetuning LLMs for comparative assessment to align the
model's output with the target distribution of comparative probabilities. By
training on soft probabilities, our approach improves state-of-the-art
performance while maintaining high performance with an efficient subset of
comparisons.",2024-09-24 11:21:43+00:00,cs.CL,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.15979v1,Finetuning_LLMs_for_Comparative_Assessment_Tasks
Automated test generation to evaluate tool-augmented LLMs as conversational AI agents,"Samuel Arcadinho, David Aparicio, Mariana Almeida","Tool-augmented LLMs are a promising approach to create AI agents that can
have realistic conversations, follow procedures, and call appropriate
functions. However, evaluating them is challenging due to the diversity of
possible conversations, and existing datasets focus only on single interactions
and function-calling. We present a test generation pipeline to evaluate LLMs as
conversational AI agents. Our framework uses LLMs to generate diverse tests
grounded on user-defined procedures. For that, we use intermediate graphs to
limit the LLM test generator's tendency to hallucinate content that is not
grounded on input procedures, and enforces high coverage of the possible
conversations. Additionally, we put forward ALMITA, a manually curated dataset
for evaluating AI agents in customer support, and use it to evaluate existing
LLMs. Our results show that while tool-augmented LLMs perform well in single
interactions, they often struggle to handle complete conversations. While our
focus is on customer support, our method is general and capable of AI agents
for different domains.",2024-09-24 09:57:43+00:00,cs.CL,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.15934v1,Automated_test_generation_to_evaluate_toolaugmented_LLMs_as_conversational_AI_agents
SLIMER-IT: Zero-Shot NER on Italian Language,"Andrew Zamai, Leonardo Rigutini, Marco Maggini, Andrea Zugarini","Traditional approaches to Named Entity Recognition (NER) frame the task into
a BIO sequence labeling problem. Although these systems often excel in the
downstream task at hand, they require extensive annotated data and struggle to
generalize to out-of-distribution input domains and unseen entity types. On the
contrary, Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong zero-shot
capabilities. While several works address Zero-Shot NER in English, little has
been done in other languages. In this paper, we define an evaluation framework
for Zero-Shot NER, applying it to the Italian language. Furthermore, we
introduce SLIMER-IT, the Italian version of SLIMER, an instruction-tuning
approach for zero-shot NER leveraging prompts enriched with definition and
guidelines. Comparisons with other state-of-the-art models, demonstrate the

Planning in the Dark: LLM-Symbolic Planning Pipeline without Experts,"Sukai Huang, Nir Lipovetzky, Trevor Cohn","Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown promise in solving natural
language-described planning tasks, but their direct use often leads to
inconsistent reasoning and hallucination. While hybrid LLM-symbolic planning
pipelines have emerged as a more robust alternative, they typically require
extensive expert intervention to refine and validate generated action schemas.
It not only limits scalability but also introduces a potential for biased
interpretation, as a single expert's interpretation of ambiguous natural
language descriptions might not align with the user's actual intent. To address
this, we propose a novel approach that constructs an action schema library to
generate multiple candidates, accounting for the diverse possible
interpretations of natural language descriptions. We further introduce a
semantic validation and ranking module that automatically filter and rank the
generated schemas and plans without expert-in-the-loop. The experiments showed
our pipeline maintains superiority in planning over the direct LLM planning
approach. These findings demonstrate the feasibility of a fully automated
end-to-end LLM-symbolic planner that requires no expert intervention, opening
up the possibility for a broader audience to engage with AI planning with less
prerequisite of domain expertise.",2024-09-24 09:33:12+00:00,cs.AI,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.15915v1,Planning_in_the_Dark_LLMSymbolic_Planning_Pipeline_without_Experts

Enhancing Text-to-SQL Capabilities of Large Language Models via Domain Database Knowledge Injection,"Xingyu Ma, Xin Tian, Lingxiang Wu, Xuepeng Wang, Xueming Tang, Jinqiao Wang","Text-to-SQL is a subtask in semantic parsing that has seen rapid progress
with the evolution of Large Language Models (LLMs). However, LLMs face
challenges due to hallucination issues and a lack of domain-specific database
knowledge(such as table schema and cell values). As a result, they can make
errors in generating table names, columns, and matching values to the correct
columns in SQL statements. This paper introduces a method of knowledge
injection to enhance LLMs' ability to understand schema contents by
incorporating prior knowledge. This approach improves their performance in
Text-to-SQL tasks. Experimental results show that pre-training LLMs on
domain-specific database knowledge and fine-tuning them on downstream
Text-to-SQL tasks significantly improves the Execution Match (EX) and Exact
Match (EM) metrics across various models. This effectively reduces errors in
generating column names and matching values to the columns. Furthermore, the
knowledge-injected models can be applied to many downstream Text-to-SQL tasks,
demonstrating the generalizability of the approach presented in this paper.",2024-09-24 09:24:03+00:00,cs.CL,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.15907v1,Enhancing_TexttoSQL_Capabilities_of_Large_Language_Models_via_Domain_Database_Knowledge_Injection

mechanism for better transfer text generation ability of LLM to speech

manages multiple languages efficiently. To further enhance the collaboration of
multiple experts and leverage the understanding capabilities of LLM, we propose
a two-stage progressive training strategy: 1) The connector is unfrozen and
trained with language-specialized experts to map speech representations to the
text space. 2) The connector and LLM LoRA adaptor are trained with the proposed
IDIT mechanism and all experts are activated to learn general representations.

Konstruktor: A Strong Baseline for Simple Knowledge Graph Question Answering,"Maria Lysyuk, Mikhail Salnikov, Pavel Braslavski, Alexander Panchenko","While being one of the most popular question types, simple questions such as
""Who is the author of Cinderella?"", are still not completely solved.
Surprisingly, even the most powerful modern Large Language Models are prone to
errors when dealing with such questions, especially when dealing with rare
entities. At the same time, as an answer may be one hop away from the question
entity, one can try to develop a method that uses structured knowledge graphs
(KGs) to answer such questions. In this paper, we introduce Konstruktor - an
efficient and robust approach that breaks down the problem into three steps:
(i) entity extraction and entity linking, (ii) relation prediction, and (iii)
querying the knowledge graph. Our approach integrates language models and
knowledge graphs, exploiting the power of the former and the interpretability
of the latter. We experiment with two named entity recognition and entity
linking methods and several relation detection techniques. We show that for
relation detection, the most challenging step of the workflow, a combination of
relation classification/generation and ranking outperforms other methods. We
report Konstruktor's strong results on four datasets.",2024-09-24 09:19:11+00:00,cs.CL,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.15902v1,Konstruktor_A_Strong_Baseline_for_Simple_Knowledge_Graph_Question_Answering
